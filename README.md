IR_Buzzer_Control
=================

Ardunio controlled by IR using an Apple Remote to alter a tones and frequency of a buzzer.

See [blog post for details](http://forefront.io/a/arduino_apple_remote_controlled_buzzer).

Some code derived from Adafruit's [Playing a Scale](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-10-making-sounds/playing-a-scale) tutorial.

Props to [Ken Shirriff](http://www.arcfn.com/) for creating the [IRremote](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote) Arduino library.
